# Fragment-In-Compose
Migrating from the Fragment system to the Compose system is often a nightmare. Recently, Google introduced new APIs in androidx-fragment to make the migration process easier for us.

- [Phase 1](https://github.com/s2g090123/Fragment-In-Compose/compare/phase1): Import the androidx-fragment-compose dependency.
- [Phase 2](https://github.com/s2g090123/Fragment-In-Compose/compare/phase2): Introduce content {} to create a ComposeView.
- [Phase 3](https://github.com/s2g090123/Fragment-In-Compose/compare/phase3): Introduce AndroidFragment to display a Fragment in Compose.
- [Phase 4](https://github.com/s2g090123/Fragment-In-Compose/compare/phase4): Currently, there is no API to use Compose Navigation within a Fragment (coming soon), so introduce the current workaround.
